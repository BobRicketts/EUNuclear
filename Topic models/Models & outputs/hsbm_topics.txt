We haven’t even gotten to the nuclear waste issue

Since we have no safe way to store the waste we already have over the period of time that it will remain dangerous, why would we consent to making even more of it?

And why would the EU add it to the ‘clean’ column (with GAS!)?
-----
This is irresponsible: Because some European Government don't want to discuss the nuclear option, they try to get one million extra tons of coal from Botswana. Annually. Additionally.

NG and LNG capacity is stretched to their limits already, VRE will provide little relief as Europe enters the darkest season with the least amount of wind and sun.

Coal and nuclear appear to be the only options with some room to provide more capacity.
-----
Japan is in the process of restarting reactors. Not sure where they are right now but they could have 10+ that could go online in 2022. That would free up LNG, since Japan is currently the largest importer, to go to Europe
